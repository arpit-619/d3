# Graph Generation

This is the bar graph generated with dynamic data which is stored on firebase. 
This graph is generated with d3.js which is a JavaScript Library. I use d3.js library because the data is visualisation is done dynamically and generates in SVG format (scalable vector graphic) to Open this file on a web to see the difference.
